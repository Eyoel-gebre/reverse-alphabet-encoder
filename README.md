# reverse-alphabet-encoder
encodes any word/sentence into a reverse alphabet

takes in a word/sentence/combination of words and encodes it, according to a reverse alphabet.
for example, if you inputed "abc" it would output "zyx".
Also has a feature that decodes text that has already been encoded. 
To use just run main.py.
